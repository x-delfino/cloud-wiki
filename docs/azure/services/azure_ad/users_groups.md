# Users and Groups

## Users
User principals can exist in one of two states in Azure:
- Cloud-only: These accounts exist only in Azure AD.
- Directory Synced (Hybrid): These accounts are synchronised with an on-premise Active Directory domain.

For detail on hybrid identities, check out the individual page [here](./hybrid_identities).
